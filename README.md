Hacker News Viewer with History
Welcome to the Hacker News Viewer, a dynamic web application designed to provide an interactive and user-friendly interface for browsing Hacker News stories. Here's what makes this project special:

Main Features:

    Dynamic Navigation: Users can navigate through Hacker News top stories using arrow keys. Left arrow moves to the previous story, right arrow to the next.
    Open in New Tab: Pressing the Enter key opens the current story in a new tab, making it easy to dive into content without losing your place in the list.
    History Tracking: A history feature allows users to revisit previously viewed stories. This is accessible via a folder icon that appears once you've viewed at least one story.
    Responsive Design: The application adjusts its layout for mobile devices, ensuring readability and usability across different screen sizes.
    First-Time User Wizard: A wizard appears on first load to guide users on how to use the navigation features, enhancing user experience for newcomers.
    Made with Love: A small credit at the bottom left corner acknowledges the creators, adding a personal touch to the project.


Development:
This project was developed entirely through interactive sessions with Grok, an AI designed to assist with coding tasks. Grok meticulously followed user requests, iteratively building and refining the application based on real-time feedback. This approach not only demonstrates the capabilities of AI in software development but also showcases how user-driven development can lead to tailored, functional applications.

Technologies Used:

    HTML5 for structure
    CSS3 for styling, including responsive design techniques
    JavaScript for interactive features, fetching data from Hacker News API, and managing state
    Local Storage for maintaining history across sessions


How to Use:

    Keyboard Navigation: Use arrow keys to move between stories.
    Enter Key: Opens the current story in a new tab.
    History: Click the folder icon in the bottom right to view your history of opened stories.


This project not only serves as a functional tool for browsing Hacker News but also as an example of how AI can assist in creating custom applications based on user specifications. Enjoy exploring the world of Hacker News with this enhanced viewer!
